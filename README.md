## Introduction

This is a python code to send each student's grade privately using
`smtplib` to send emails from python and `csv` to deal with csv file
of grades and students' names.

## Send Grades

As you can see in [sample.csv](sample.csv) you should have a sheet like
this (if your column names are different feel free to change them in code):

```python
FIRST_NAME_COLUMN = "Ù†Ø§Ù…"
LAST_NAME_COLUMN = "Ù†Ø§Ù… Ø®Ø§Ù†ÙˆØ§Ø¯Ú¯ÛŒ"
STUDENT_ID_COLUMN = "Ø´Ù…Ø§Ø±Ù‡ Ø¯Ø§Ù†Ø´Ø¬ÙˆÛŒÛŒ"
EMAIL_COLUMN = "Ø§ÛŒÙ…ÛŒÙ„"
NOTE_COLUMN = "ØªÙˆØ¶ÛŒØ­Ø§Øª"
SKIPPED_ROWS = 2
```

Then you can fill [subject.txt](subject.txt) and [body.html](body.html) with the text that
you want to send as your email subject and its body. e.g.

```html
<html>
  <body dir="rtl">
    <p>
      Ø¨Ø§ Ø³Ù„Ø§Ù…<br />
      Ø¯Ø§Ù†Ø´Ø¬ÙˆÛŒ Ø¹Ø²ÛŒØ² {{ name }}<br />
      Ù†Ù…Ø±Ù‡ ØªÙ…Ø±ÛŒÙ† Ø´Ù…Ø§
    </p>
    <table>
      <tbody>
        {% for name, grade in grades.items() %}
        <tr>
          <td>{{ name }}</td>
          <td>{{ grade }}</td>
        </tr>
        {% endfor %}
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>
      Ø¯Ø± ØµÙˆØ±Øª Ù‡Ø±Ú¯ÙˆÙ†Ù‡ Ø§Ø¹ØªØ±Ø§Ø¶ ÛŒØ§ Ù…Ø´Ú©Ù„ÛŒ Ø¨Ø§ Ø§ÛŒÙ…ÛŒÙ„ Ø²ÛŒØ± Ø¯Ø± ØªÙ…Ø§Ø³ Ø¨Ø§Ø´ÛŒØ¯.<br />

      <a href="mailto:parham.alvani@gmail.com">Pahram Alvani</a>
    </p>
  </body>
</html>
```

As you can see, this is a jinja template, and you have variables that is set for each student.
Please note that you can check the emails before actually sending them with `--dry-run` flag.

## Enter SMTP/Email Address

After fixing sheets and changing txt files run the program and enter your smtp address
and after that your email address and its password in configuration file. e.g.

```yaml
---
email:
  server: smtp.gmail.com
  username: parham.alvani@gmail.com
  password: secret
```

Note that if you use GMail you must go to your Google account and change
_Less secure app access_ [here](https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps) by turning on
_Allow less secure apps_. Otherwise you need to use
[application-specific passwords](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en).

## Installation

You just need to install pandas using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to run this program.

```bash
pip install .
python3 harpocrates
```

## Examples

Here you can see some examples of emails I sent from sample csv files:
