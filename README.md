# Email_grades_privately

This is a python code to send each student's grade privately using smtplib to send emails from python and pandas to deal with csv file of grades and students' names.

For using this code you need to first convert your sheet to csv and give the address of csv file to the code. It's better to have 4 columns with same name as the names of columns in sample.csv but if your column names are different you can change names in code. Then After choosing columns and getting their data, write the subject and body of your message in body.txt and subject.txt files. After running the code enter your smtp address and then your email address and its password and wait for it to send all the emails.  

## Installation

You just need to install pandas using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to run this program.

```bash
pip3 install pandas
```
